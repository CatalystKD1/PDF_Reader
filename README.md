# PDF_Reader
A Simple project that will allow users to select a PDF from their local device and allow the text to speech to read it.

There is a dowloadable .exe file within the dist folder.
Perhaps I will return to this project to add in features to change the speech program, and select a different file, but for now, this is the project.
